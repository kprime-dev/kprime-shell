# To Do

## version 1.0.0

## Usability Issues

* set context on first run.
* manage server contexts without requiring a context.
* print server info such as CLI/kotlin version.
* add command use <server.nam> to get a comfortable server switch.

## Technical Issues

- new properties are used only on CLI restart.
